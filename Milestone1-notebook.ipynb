    "For our project, we are looking to explore global economic developments pertaining to trade protectionism. An interesting dataset we came across was one posted by Global Trade Alert, an initiative by the Center for Policy Research which provides full coverage of the trade-discriminatory measures all across the globe. We are interested in observing the trends of these measures over the past few years, how this has evolved from region-to-region, what types of trade discriminatory measures countries have resorted to, and how some of the measures implemented align with the country’s said objectives.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The dataset provided by Global Trade Alert provides tons of information that helps us to answer these questions. Starting from 2008, the dataset lists which countries have implemented such measures, along with the countries they are implemented on. It provides the type of the measure – non-tariff or tariff, on what products, and whether the measure is currently in force. GTA also have a unique “color” indicator which states the serious of measure, with red classifying those which certainty discriminates foreign commercial interests, yellow which could potential deter foreign commercial interests, and green which pertain to more liberalizing (i.e. Anti-trade) measures. \n",
    "    \n",
    "As mentioned earlier, this dataset provides an opportunity to pursue one, or many of our said goals. With the rapid global trade developments across the world, ranging from US-China trade war, China’s New Silk Road, and Brexit, it would be interesting to conduct a time-series analysis on the change in the global trade landscape since the 2008 recession. We are currently looking for a data set that matches the one with GTA but goes further back than 2008. Another key question we look to analyze is how the global landscape has evolved since the 2008 financial crises. Part of the severity of the recession in 2008 was linked to “global interconnectedness,” where trouble in the major developed and developing countries had subsequent negative effects on other smaller and more dependent economies. It will be interesting to whether countries have now taken steps to protect themselves from external factors by insulating themselves from the global trade environment, either relying on themselves for the provisions of goods and services or focusing on more “regional” trade developments as opposed to global."
